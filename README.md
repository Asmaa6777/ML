Welcome to my personal machine learning repository. Here, I document my learning journey through competitions, side projects, and experiments with real-world data. This space serves as both a learning log and a resource for others interested in applied machine learning. Whether you're just starting out or seeking inspiration, feel free to explore, learn, and reuse the work shared here.
